# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
After helping Maria analyize "City School" records, it was determined that there was academic dishonesty. The school in question, Thomas High School. 
The Reading and Math grades for all ninth graders at THS show evidence of being altered. We replaced ninth grade math and reading scores with null values to find the impact this has had on our overall analysis.  

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

* How the district summary affected?

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
