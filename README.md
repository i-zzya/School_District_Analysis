# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  We have been asked to help Maria clean up data once again after learning that data obtained originally shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The altered data is specific to ninth graders. We are to nullify math and reading scores for 9th graders while keeping the rest of the data for grades 10th through 12th the same. After doing so we checked to see the impact of academic tampering had on Thomas Highschool's overall performance.
